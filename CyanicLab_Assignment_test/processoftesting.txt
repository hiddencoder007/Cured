Hello Sir,

firstly open terminal and enter npm run serverRun
start server http://localhost:5000/
now enter the form entry
then click on enter data
now /fetches will open with all entry that you have entered
and form all the task like update,delete,logout etc.

soft delete works as if you delete then it works with Boolean. Before delete the status of the entry 
is false then after delete it turns into true and get the all delete data on url http://localhost:5000/deleteditems
